Use QTDesigner to make the gui (way easier), then go into python and define the callbacks

for building the gui, be in the gui environment (conda activate gui). It has fbs and pyqt5 installed.
use fbs freeze while in Webapp\gui to build. Use --debug tag to get debug info. If you get "Permission Denied" error try building again immediately, otherwise check windows, etc. are closed.

for flask program, have to run in pytorch environment (conda activate pytorch). It has pytorch installed. Run flaskAPI\wear2bmp.py
Need to deploy real version of server.
